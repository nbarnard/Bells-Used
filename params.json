{"name":"Bells Used Plugin for MuseScore 1.2","tagline":"Flexible Bells Used Information for Composers and Directors","google":"","body":"### Bells Used Plugin for MuseScore 1.2\r\n\r\nBells Used Plugin is for [MuseScore 1.2](http://musescore.org), it generates Bells Used information and can present it in a score format, a text file, or as CSV file for use with spreadsheet software.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nTo Install Bells Used Plugin:\r\n* Download the ZIP file.\r\n* Unzip the file.\r\n* Close MuseScore.\r\n* Place the files in the [MuseScore Plugin Directory](http://musescore.org/en/handbook/plugins).\r\n* Load MuseScore.\r\n* The plugin can be accessed from the Plugin->Bells Used Menu\r\n\r\n### Using the Plugin\r\n\r\nWhen you are ready to create a Bells Used Chart select it from the plugin menu:![Bells Used Menu Location: Plugin->Bells Used->Create Bells Used](http://raw.github.com/nbarnard/img/master/bells-used/menu.png)\r\n\r\nThere are several options that can be selected each time the plugin is run. By default the plugin will store your last used options.\r\n\r\n#### Score\r\nBy default the Bells Used Plugin will create a new score:![Dialog at defaults](http://raw.github.com/nbarnard/img/master/bells-used/dialog-default.png)\r\n\r\nBy default the plugin will create a score with the Piano as the instrument. See [Blank Name Instrument](#blankname) to create a score without the Piano name.\r\n\r\n#### Plain Text\r\n![Dialog with Text Selected](http://raw.github.com/nbarnard/img/master/bells-used/dialog-text.png)\r\n\r\nWhen Plain Text output is selected there are two additional options available:\r\n* Use \"Real\" sharps and flats: When checked the plugin will use Unicode Sharp, Flat, Double Sharp, and Double Flat symbols in text outputs. Uncheck this option if the text is not readable. If this option is unchecked the plugin will output \"#\" for Sharps and \"b\" for Flats, utilizing two of each for Double Sharps and Double Flats\r\n* Copy to Clipboard: When checked, the plugin will copy the Bells Used information to the clipboard instead of saving the information to a file.\r\n\r\n#### CSV\r\n![Dialog with CSV Selected](http://raw.github.com/nbarnard/img/master/bells-used/dialog-csv.png)\r\n\r\nWhen CSV output is selected, all the plain text options are available, and an additional option is available:\r\n* Include Header Row: When checked, the first row of the CSV file will have a header describing each of the columns. \r\n\r\n### Preferences\r\n![Preferences Dialog](http://raw.github.com/nbarnard/img/master/bells-used/preferences.png)\r\n\r\nThe Bells Used Plugin has several options that you can set to streamline your workflow:\r\n* Use Blank Name Instrument: Uses an instrument without a title instead of the Piano. To function properly, the instrument must be installed as described in the [Blank Name Instrument Installation](#blankname) section.\r\n* Save Last Used Output Options: When checked the plugin will save the last used output options for the next use. If unchecked the plugin will use the last saved options. \r\n* Bypass Output Options Dialog: When checked the plugin will not present the output options dialog, and instead will use the last saved or the default options.\r\n* Set Default Options: Will bring up a dialog that allows you to set the default options. These options will be overwritten last used options if Save Last USed Output Options above is checked.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"blankname\"></a>Blank Name Instrument\r\n\r\n### Score Output Quirks\r\nWhen generating a score, the Bells Used Plugin generates a score that is visually correct when printed, but it has several adjustments to achieve this presentation. \r\n\r\n![Bells Used Score Output Example](http://raw.github.com/nbarnard/img/master/bells-used/score-example.png)\r\n\r\n* Notes that are already represented by a different enharmonic representation are printed with an X notehead. In this example the A&#9837;4 is printed with an X notehead, as it is already represented by the G&#9839;4. Similarly, the B&#9837;4 is printed with an X notehead, as it is represented by the A&#9839;4. (Preexisting precedent is to place the related enharmonics within parens. MuseScore does not allow plugins to access the paren symbols.) \r\n* Notes that are follow their related flat are printed as a flat. In this example, G&#9838;4 is printed as a G&#9837;4 so that the natural symbol is not printed, per precedent for Bells Used Charts. Similarly, the B&#9838;4 is printed as a B&#9837;4. (This is due to a restriction on plugins in MuseScore that the accidental symbol cannot be suppressed or hidden.)\r\n* Several quarter notes are written in the staff that has a fewer number of notes. In this example, five E6 quarter notes are printed. These notes are automatically hidden and are not visible in the printed form (This is due to a restriction on plugins in MuseScore being unable to hide rests.)\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
